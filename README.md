# Project \#4 - # Beer Recommender System #
--------
My fourth project at Metis involved applying unsupervised learning techniques. As a lover of craft beer, I often check BeerAdvocate reviews to make sure the beer I am ordering (or buying in a store) is a good choice. I set out to create a recommender system that would take in BeerAdvocate text reviews and produce a list of beers to try based on similarity to a favorite beer and priority for recommendations (i.e. recommendations sorted by: overall rating, smell, taste, look, feel or alcohol content).
